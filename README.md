# Genetic Algorithm Solution for Polygon Decomposition
<img float="left" src="https://github.com/mehmetakifakkus/jslab/blob/v2/app/public/images/partitioning-thumbnail.png" width="200"/>This web application shows available sub-polygon decomposition of a simple polygon. You will immediately see the result exactly on the polygon.

This app is ultimately interactive. At first, it comes with default simple polygon. You can modify the polygon using hints at the bottom of the page.
